#TODO Application

I have created a simple todolist application based on java and SQLitebase databse with 3 interfaces as front interface , addtask interface and list interface. It has functionalities like mark the tasks that you did , edit tasks and delete tasks from the list. 
The following shows the small video clip of my mobile application.
